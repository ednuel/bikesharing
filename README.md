# Overview of the project
### Our job is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal! We will be using Tableau Public tp help us decide if having a bike-sharing program will be as successful as the bike-sharing programs in New York City. What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
